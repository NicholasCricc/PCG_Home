Procedural Content Generation Unity 3D Game - "DynamicExplorer"
Overview
Welcome to "DynamicExplorer," an innovative Unity 3D game that leverages procedural content generation across three distinct scenes. Each scene offers unique challenges and dynamic gameplay experiences:

Scene 1: Procedural Maze
Navigate through a dynamically generated maze where the win point is strategically placed among a set of points. Challenge yourself to find the optimal path and reach the win point to advance.
